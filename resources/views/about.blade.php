    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>RPISEC is a computer security organization comprised primarily of students and alumni from <a href="" target="_blank">HCMUT</a>. We were founded to provide resources for those interested in exploring the world of computer security.</p>
    <p>At our core, we are a group of self-taught security enthusiasts who enjoy sharing our knowledge with those interested in learning. We believe in the freedom of information, and do our best to prepare resources, organize meetings, and host educational events on our own time. See our current officers at <a href="./member">Member</a>.</p>

These presentations are open to anyone and include topics such as binary exploitation, assembly level reverse engineering, malware analysis, web security, cryptography, network security, digital forensics, and physical security (such as lockpicking).</p>

    <p>These meetings are typically held in CII 4050 on Fridays from 6:00pm to 8:00pm. Any changes to this schedule will be announced on our <a href="./contact">mailing list</a>.</p>
